    "# Abstract\n",
    ">We present our submission for the IBM Quantum Open Science Prize, which focuses on the simulation of the XXX Heisenberg spin model on real quantum hardware. The keystone of our approach is the use of Incremental Structural Learning (ISL), a quantum algorithm for approximate circuit recompilation, to find circuits that produce approximately the same state as the desired time evolution circuit with significantly fewer gates. The trial solution is built and optimised incrementally, with the structure of each layer informed by the entanglement properties of the original circuit. Our open-source implementation, built as part of this challenge, is available at [github.com/abhishekagarwal2301/isl/](https://github.com/abhishekagarwal2301/isl/).\n",
    "<br><br>Combining this method with measurement calibration, we achieve a 99.3\\% fidelity on the tomography benchmark for the evolved state at $t=\\pi$. Furthermore, to demonstrate the general applicability of our solution beyond this special case, we reconstruct the probability of the $|110\\rangle$ state across the entire range $t=(0, \\pi)$ on $ibmq\\_jakarta$. Excitingly, despite the more complicated entanglement spectrum of the system at these intermediate times, our results match the form of the analytic solution, producing a probability on average within 2.4 percentage points of the true value."

    "One of the leading uses for quantum computers will be to simulate quantum systems such as molecules or engineered materials. Actually executing a quantum simulation on a current quantum computer, however, can be difficult and error prone. Your objective for this Open Science Prize is to significantly improve the state-of-the-art for quantum simulation (details in Section 2).\n",

    "The quantum system you will simulate is a quantum spin-1/2 model, where each qubit represents a quantum [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) particle in a 1D chain. Quantum spin models have some amazing properties and uses. Computationally speaking, [certain optimization problems can be mapped](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05771.pdf) to spin models and hence minimized on a quantum computer. Physically speaking, spin models show a variety of quantum behavior such as large entangled states, quantum phases of matter, quantum many-body affects, and many other open questions in physics research.\n",

It can also be difficult to simulate, which is where you come in.\n",

The evolution must be done using Trotterization with at least 4 steps ($n\\geq4$). You will be judged on the clarity, originiality, and creativity of your solution, as well as the fidelity of the evolved state at time $t=\\pi$ using [state tomography](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/noise/8_tomography.html). State tomography is a way of determining the exact quantum state--even phase information--at the end of a quantum circuit by running the circuit multiple times and measuring in different bases. The closer your final quantum state to the expected state, the higher the fidelity. Ibmq_jakarta's qubits 0, 2, 4, and 6 will not be evaluated by the state tomography calculation, so you may use them as you wish. You do not need to follow the same decomposition given in the example above, but your solution must be a Trotterization of $U_{\\text{heis3}}(t)$ with at least 4 steps ($n\\geq4$).

Conversely, our error mitigation approach can be summarised almost entirely by trying to produce the same time evolution with as few gates as possible. This can lead to significant reductions in the noise accumulated on real devices, which grows exponentially with the number of logic gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution uses an AQCR algorithm known as Incremental Structural Learning (ISL). More details about ISL as well as our submission can be found in the supplementary PDF. The aim of ISL is to find a quantum circuit which approximates the action of a target circuit on a given input to within some tolerance. Typically, this problem is approached by trialing different parameterised circuits, known as ansatzes, however this can prove expensive and runs into trainability issues. Instead of optimising a fixed circuit, ISL incrementally builds and optimises an ansatz informed by the entanglement present in the system. Here, each layer of the ansatz is a thinly dressed CNOT gate - a CNOT gate surrounded by 4 single qubit rotations. This process repeats layer-by-layer until the desired threshold is met. This threshold is based on the overlap between the state produced by the original circuit and the ISL solution. More formally, the cost we are minimising is\n",

    "\n",
    "where $V$ and $U$ are the recompiled and original circuit respectively. ISL terminates once $C$ is less than or equal to a value we call the \"sufficient cost\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst the ideas behind the ISL method have been available publicly since 2020 and have been applied to research problems before, their implementation has previously remained in the private domain. Therefore, we consider a significant part of our submission to be the development of an open-source and easy to use implementation of ISL, which we hope others can use and extend further. Rather than import supplementary Python files, in the spirit of the Open Science Prize, we have made the core of our solution available through the public repository https://github.com/abhishekagarwal2301/isl and have also published it on PyPi.

    "Now that we understand how ISL can provide shallower approximate equivalents of quantum circuits, we move on to the problem at hand. If we are to simulate the evolution of the XXX model on real quantum hardware there will be two sources of error: from the device and from our Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. In this section, we'd first like to eliminate the latter, so that we can focus purely on error mitigation of the device. Since the Trotter error grows as the size of the discrestised time slice $\\delta t$, we aim to find the number of time slices required for it to be negligible. Here we define negligible Trotter error as the minimum number of Trotter steps required to reproduce the original |110> evolution graph within visual convergence. This is an alternative to other methods of estimating Trotter error."

    "Here we see that for a trial sufficient cost of 0.001 (99.9% overlap between the original and recompiled states), our recompiled solution is able to reproduce the observed population over the full evolution. Most importantly, it is able to do so with significantly shallower circuits than the direct Trotterised implementation. Here the Trotterised evolution circuits contain 10 CNOT gates per Trotter step (transpiling with optimisation level 3). By comparison, ISL finds an approximately equivalent circuit to within 99.9% overlap with on average 3 CNOT gates, for **any** number of Trotter steps. This difference is most notable when obtaining the population at the final time $t=\\pi$, where the direct Trotterised implementation requires 10*35=350$ CNOT gates.\n",

    "The presence of device noise does introduce a trade off for ISL: a lower sufficient cost will lead to a recompiled circuit which outputs a state much closer to the target state, however, for more complex target states this could lead to deeper circuits. These additional gates will in turn produce noise that offsets the theoretical benefit of the higher overlap between the target and recompiled circuits. To determine the optimal trade off between the accuracy of the recompilation and depth of circuit, we repeat our experiment for increasing ISL sufficient costs. This trade off can be explored using the slider in the graph below."

    "Now device noise has been introduced, the standard Trotterisation procedure quickly fails. Looking across, as time increases, alongside the circuit depth, the observed probability decays exponentially such that by $t=1.0$ the qubits are being measured in a purely random state. Interestingly, this demonstrates the exponential relationship between noise and number of gates as well as the exponential decay of the qubits. Notably, the standard Trotterised circuits fails to capture any of the important physics of the Heisenberg model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the significantly shallower circuits produced by the ISL algorithm generate far less noise. The result of this is a simulation where the measured probability of the |110> is much closer to the form of the analytic solution. Importantly, the number of gates of our recompiled solution does not grow linearly with the simulation time and thus avoids the exponential decay of the observed signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another result we can see here is the accuracy of the final solution with respect to the ISL sufficient cost, which is  (of the state produced by the ISL solution and original circuit respectively). At the furthest left of the slider, with sufficient cost 0.1, the ISL result is inaccurate, deviating at many points from the true solution. In this case, the approximately equivalent circuits produce states with only 90% overlap, and this large difference leads to different measured probabilities of the |110> state. Increasing the slider we see performance improve, with the stricter recompilation threshold leading to ISL solutions that more faithfully reproduce the dynamics. The accuracy of our solution appears to peak for a sufficient cost of 0.001, before plateauing and even reducing for higher cost. This effect is due to the aforementioned trade-off between overlap and number of gates required to obtain that accuracy. Now that gate noise is present, an increased number of gates has visible consequences for the accuracy of the final solution. Adjusting the slider, we see that the optimal sufficient cost for ISL is 0.001, which we use going forward. "
