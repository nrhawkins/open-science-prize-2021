    "Now that we understand how ISL can provide shallower approximate equivalents of quantum circuits, we move on to the problem at hand. If we are to simulate the evolution of the XXX model on real quantum hardware there will be two sources of error: from the device and from our Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. In this section, we'd first like to eliminate the latter, so that we can focus purely on error mitigation of the device. Since the Trotter error grows as the size of the discrestised time slice $\\delta t$, we aim to find the number of time slices required for it to be negligible.\n",

Firstly, increased Trotter steps leads to smaller time slices, producing more discrete points across the evolution. Most importantly however, the smaller time slices leads to reduced error from the decomposition, such that we observe convergence with the analytic solution as the slider is increased. Overall, we see that 35 Trotter steps is sufficient for reproducing the probability evolution from 0 to pi to a level where the error will be insignificant compared to the device noise."

Most importantly, it is able to do so with significantly shallower circuits than the direct Trotterised implementation. Here the Trotterised evolution circuits contain 10 CNOT gates per Trotter step (transpiling with optimisation level 3). By comparison, ISL finds an approximately equivalent circuit to within 99.9% overlap with on average 3 CNOT gates, for **any** number of Trotter steps.
